Be a Shepherd or a Sheep Dog, never a Wolf

A Shepherd and a hired hand are very different. The hired hand, like a wolf, would feast on the fattened Rams while the lambs starve. Then he would devour the rest of the flock. If danger comes, he flees.

A Shepherd knows his flock by name or at least by sight. He will risk his own safety for a newborn lamb . The flock knows their shepherd. He protects and guides them. They love and respect each other.

The Shepherd asks a lot of the flock in return. Sometimes, they must sacrifice a lamb or cull a ram. Other times, he requires their wool. It is a give and take relationship.

A Shepherd sleeps among his flock,
their danger is his danger.

A Shepherd eats once the flock is fed,
he cares for them first
and can live on the crumbs or bounty,
once their needs are met

A Shepherd doesn't run from danger,
but doesn't seek it out.

A Shepherd knows their flock
who they known them in return

The flock looks to the Shepherd for guidance.
so a Shepherd leads the way.

If a Shepherd falls,
the flock will flee,
so don't give up the fight.

If danger shows,
now is your chance,
to your show bravery.

You're scared,
that's normal,
I'm scared too.
It's ok once in a while.

But will you do what's right,
what's best,
even for a while?

The time is now,
this is the moment,
you must now begin

To lead,
to choose
to do what's right,
find a better path.

You will not flee,
but rather choose,
starting here and now.

You lead by choosing, it the difference between a Sheep Dog and a Wolf. Both are dangerous, both are dogs with the same animal instincts. The difference is how they view and treat the flock. Friend or food? Am I here for the benefit of the flock, or do I see them as a benefit to me?

Politicians should beware if they are Wolves. Wolves only want to feed on the flock. There are true leaders, but they are leaders first, and then a political leader without becoming a Politician. These are rare, or at least have been.

If you are a Politician, Lead! Be the Person you expect us to become. Become a Shepherd. Wolves should beware if a flock wakes up and sees them as they are.

You lead by keeping an eye on the surroundings, watching the horizon like a Shepherd would. What is threatening the flock? What will be threatening the flock? How would he respond if there was a threat?

Do you use the threats to control the flock? What might happen to them, or imagined fears of a future that need not exist? A frightened flock can be easy to control, until they aren't. Rams are a threat to Wolves, too.

A Shepherd thinks about where the flock can be fed and watered and guides them there.
A Shepherd keeps an eye out for dangers and predators from inside or outside the flock
A Shepherd cares for the flock and finds any that are lost. No one left behind.

Every Sheep is precious, especially Lambs. They need the most protection. Any true Shepherd, anywhere, any time, would protect any Lamb.

You may not be a Shepherd yet, but you can be a Sheep Dog. A Sheep Dog is not a sheep, but it is more than just a dog. A Sheep Dog is like a Shepherd in Training. He has a job to do, a duty. They help protect the flock by living among them. Some give their lives to protect the flock, others are just willing to. The best Sheep Dogs become Shepherds one day.

A Sheep Dog holds it's ground when threatened.
A Sheep Dog does not bite, except to defend the flock.
A Sheep Dog is always in control of their dog nature
A Wolf is never safe around a Sheep Dog. Predators beware.

A Wolf is a dog too. If just gives into the natural dog nature and sees the flock as food. They are Predators and a threat to the flock. A dog tends to be a Wolf unless it is trained to be a Sheep Dog.

### What about a Hired Hand?

It's ok to be hired to do a job and be paid for it. A Hired Hand is not necessarily a Wolf, but beware. A Wolf can pretend to be a Shepherd but the flock can eventually tell the difference.

If you think leadership is about fame and money, are you trying to be a Wolf or a Sheep Dog? Leadership is about sacrifice. About loving those you lead even if you can't be loved in return. The reason you may feel alone is you don't see the flock because they are behind you and you don't know if they are still there. A Shepherd leads even a flock of One. You can be a Shepherd without a flock. Yet.

Being a leader has it's perks but a true leader gives more than they receive. Never let it go to your head. A Shepherd was a Sheep once, a Lamb even. Once a Sheep, they choose to continue to be a Sheep, become a Sheep Dog or become a Wolf.

Wolves can become Sheep Dogs but they have to change their nature first, and start thinking about the flock. It's hard at first, but they must before the Sheep Dogs catch the Wolf. Wolves are not safe from Shepherds or Sheep Dogs, not ever. So Wolves should flee.

Lead from the front.
Lead like a Shepherd

Choose your flock first
You can be a flock of One
