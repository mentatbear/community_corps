I've spend more time alone with a computer than any human should.

I showed unusual skill at a young age with computers. I was the beneficiary of computer science education in kindergarten in the early 80's outside Chicago. We would go to a room off the library and work on computers similar to an other class. I now know now the language was Logo. It involves writing and type commands to move a turtle around the screen to make patterns. For example, move 10 spaces ahead, turn 90 degrees to the right and repeat if 4 times. The turtle
s pen should be down the entire time. This would draw a square. I believe it was part of some type of program or study from a University.

I didn't do much with computers until I had essentially the same class in 6th grade. Same langage, same premise. The class this time had students who where the children of programmers and engineers for a large software company in the area. WordPerfect. They owned the word processor market, but lost out eventually to Microsoft Word. At the time they were a big deal. They donated the entire computer lab to the elementary school I was attending. It even had a dedicated teacher.

He pulled me aside one day and said essentially, "I don't know what this is, but you have an unusual gift with computers, you should look into it". Meh. I didn't really like computers that much.

There is an excitment about them, but such predictability. It's like all the joy was sucked out of thw world and only logic remained. The ultimate mindless automoton. An unthinking, unfeeling, mindless machine. A machine that can print money it seems.

From a business perspective, software is obsenely profitable. Ask some of the richest men in the world right now. The Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Jeff Bezos of thw world. Microsoft, Apple, Amazon. None existed just a few short decades ago but in a generation became juggernauts.

If you want to make a ton of money long term, put an engineer in charge, not an MBA. Need examples? Aside from Amazon (who makes their profit from the AWS Cloud, not by dropping off packages), Microsoft (same now),

See even more profitable is a subscription software as a service based business. Subscriptions on a app on your phone. Businesses subscribe to software like Office, Zoom, Jira, Confluence. Even if the names are unfamiliar, if you work at a computer, you now pay , . Predicable money, like a machine. Every month a steady steam, with fixed costs. The cost for hosting servers. Enough to handle peak demand. The Cyber Mondays and the Superbowl type events.

The cloud started with Amazon selling their extra capacity. As a service. Poof! You need another server. Just pay and hourly fee. Need to store files online? Just pay for how much you need.

The fixed costs have become flexible with the introduction for the cloud. This leaves the cloud providers in a very powerful situation.

Who uses the cloud? Other than the federal / state / local governments, military, almost the entire Fortune 1000 (they have private clouds hosted in data centers), medium businesses, small businesses. Big businesses- Netflix (Amazon), Walmart (Microsoft).

What's GE been up to lately, Jack? Don't chase off your innovators by deciding they are the bottom 10%.

Software is . Software engineers and computer scientists will do it for fun, in their free time, and give it away for free. The entire world is build on open source software, that while some were paid to produce, most never see a dime. It's the challenge of the problems.

I'm a cloud expert (multiple top level certifications)
I'm an expert in Cybersecurity (a bachelors degree in it plus a bunch more certifications)

It's going to seem made up at this point because the words seem made up to most people
I specialize in DevOps and DevSecOps (again certifications- like AWS DevOps Engineer Professional certification)
I studied Computer Engineering (at least through). I was admitted to BYU (a local university and big deal in my town) through an early admissions program and didn't finish my last 2 years of high school.
I have worked as a professional progrmmer with live, production code since I was 15.

Yet I don't feel enough, and I still don't really like computers. They are so stupid. Try a stack overflow sometime at 3 AM. You may shudder at the thought, but chances are you are like, "is he talking about a toilet or a sink or something". Such is the nature of jargon. Like Babel, if it's not your field.

It's hard to find people to talk to face to face anymore. When communities are small, you know the people around you.

The was a Russian Babuska that worked at a store I used to shop at in the outskirts of Moscow. I explained that while I was in Russia, I was like a celebate monk, a priest, a missionary. Once I was done, like military service, I would be free to find a nice girl, marry and have lots of babies. I think she offered her daughter.

I keep getting emails from the department of defense to come work for them. I never gave them my email address. Maybe they bought a list of Cybersecurity graduate from WGU, or from one of the certification organizations.

These could be oddly specific though. Like Deputy Chief Engineer, Chief Engineer for CISA essentially The IT agency for the Department of Defense. I never applied because I figured I'd never pass a background check. Not with a history of being bi-polar. Or manic. Although I am about as white bread, plain vanilia, good Mormon Missionary, Eagle Scout, God, Family, Country, why bother. I'm a type I bi-polar manic depressive, with several Complex PTSD.

My PTSD is triggered by the thought of spending one more minute of my life chained to a screen, talking to a computer, alone.

Don't get me wrong. I love to be alone. I am about as introverted as you can get. Heaven to me was at the bottom of a river valley, camping by the natural Buffalo river, alone on the shore. Probably not a human for miles. No cell service, WiFi, even satelite on my phone was a challenge for texts. Like being alone, with God and having some time all to ourselves, even if it was just so he could show me what He made for me. Thanks, Dad. I miss You.

The suburbs crush my soul. I live, but I'm not alive. I try, it's so convenient. Everything is delivered to you. Food, clothes, you name it. Everything is relatively near.

It's too easy. Too easy to get into a routine. Go through the motions while to world races by. Before you know it, a decade or two has passed. The curtains might have changed, but little else has. At least of you are not a parent. I feel trapped. I need the country. But the country requires work to survive.

The country is break taking. Nature, painted as if it were brush stokes by the hand of God. A sunrise on the Great Plains, and you can see the entire sky- horizon to horizon. Or how the sun sets behind the Rocky Mountains. Also, 4the night sky, vast and infinite, yet still a sea of lights. The opportunities are endless. Beauty and majesty everywhere like fingerprints from a loving Creator.

I don't know how to not feel wonder and awe even thinking about the experience.

I missed sunrise one it seems in the suburbs. I saw it sometimes, but never experienced it. I'm not blaming anyone. There were trees in the way, and houses, and street lights. Everything that men create Forget the sky entirely.

At the bottom of the valley in the National River, there is no external light. A dark sky. Nothing between you and the infinite expanse. A place to feel how small you are in the vast Universe. Less than a speck of dust in a desert, or a drop in a seemingly endless sea. Nothing. Yet, there is something out there that is more than you, yet still cares. A God that notices the sparrow. You are precious, if not to Him (maybe you believe you are the smartest intelligence in the Universe and it's just random noise - feel free).

Who ever you are, where ever you are, you deserve to matter. If not to Yourself, to Us.

Us. U.S. US.

We need to Unite. I matter, You matter, We matter. We need to do better. We can. I pray we will.

God, Father, please show Us how. How to stop the generational hate. Our own hate, Our hate for ourselves and each other. It's evil.

Help us to share of the bounty this earth provides. Some have every advantage, yet waste it. Others

Some of the things you do seem evil at first. Why give a little girl, cancer? Is't that evil. I know, the love she showed and shared touched so many lives. That was her spark, it was so bright, it was enough that it was so painfully short. Her spark left a light on the world. It still shines, even dimly.

At a time in my life, I was suffering a severe episode of PTSD, depression. I could barely drag myself out of bed. I sat dutify at my computer, doing the tricks everyone loved, but felt the cold have of death on my sholder as I did. It was like a knife was held at my thoat. Om may other sholder, I felt my Saviors hand on it. As long as I could feel Him, I could keep going, even though it was literally killing me. Sometimes quickly, always slowly.
