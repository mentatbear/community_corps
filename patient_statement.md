# Patient Statement

I've spend more time alone with a computer than any human should.

I showed unusual skill at a young age with computers. I was the beneficiary of computer science education in kindergarten in the early 80's outside Chicago. We would go to a room off the library and work on computers similar to an other class. I now know now the language was Logo. It involves writing and type commands to move a turtle around the screen to make patterns. For example, move 10 spaces ahead, turn 90 degrees to the right and repeat if 4 times. The turtle
s pen should be down the entire time. This would draw a square. I believe it was part of some type of program or study from a University.

I didn't do much with computers until I had essentially the same class in 6th grade. Same langage, same premise. The class this time had students who where the children of programmers and engineers for a large software company in the area. WordPerfect. They owned the word processor market, but lost out eventually to Microsoft Word. At the time they were a big deal. They donated the entire computer lab to the elementary school I was attending. It even had a dedicated teacher.

He pulled me aside one day and said essentially, "I don't know what this is, but you have an unusual gift with computers, you should look into it". Meh. I didn't really like computers that much.

There is an excitment about them, but such predictability. It's like all the joy was sucked out of thw world and only logic remained. The ultimate mindless automoton. An unthinking, unfeeling, mindless machine. A machine that can print money it seems.

From a business perspective, software is obsenely profitable. Ask some of the richest men in the world right now. The Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Jeff Bezos of thw world. Microsoft, Apple, Amazon. None existed just a few short decades ago but in a generation became juggernauts.

If you want to make a ton of money long term, put an engineer in charge, not an MBA. Need examples? Aside from Amazon (who makes their profit from the AWS Cloud, not by dropping off packages), Microsoft (same now),

See even more profitable is a subscription software as a service based business. Subscriptions on a app on your phone. Businesses subscribe to software like Office, Zoom, Jira, Confluence. Even if the names are unfamiliar, if you work at a computer, you now pay , . Predicable money, like a machine. Every month a steady steam, with fixed costs. The cost for hosting servers. Enough to handle peak demand. The Cyber Mondays and the Superbowl type events.

The cloud started with Amazon selling their extra capacity. As a service. Poof! You need another server. Just pay and hourly fee. Need to store files online? Just pay for how much you need.

The fixed costs have become flexible with the introduction for the cloud. This leaves the cloud providers in a very powerful situation.

Who uses the cloud? Other than the federal / state / local governments, military, almost the entire Fortune 1000 (they have private clouds hosted in data centers), medium businesses, small businesses. Big businesses- Netflix (Amazon), Walmart (Microsoft).

What's GE been up to lately, Jack? Don't chase off your innovators by deciding they are the bottom 10%.

Software is . Software engineers and computer scientists will do it for fun, in their free time, and give it away for free. The entire world is build on open source software, that while some were paid to produce, most never see a dime. It's the challenge of the problems.

I'm a cloud expert (multiple top level certifications)
I'm an expert in Cybersecurity (a bachelors degree in it plus a bunch more certifications)

What does returning to my job at a computer look like?

Hell. Decades of forced slavery and labor in solitary confinement. Forever alone, never done. Like Sisyphus pushing a rock up a hill, over and over for eternity. No end to new tech to keep up with. No end to the work. All hours, all days. A merciless taskmaster that demands to be fed, never satisfied, never sleeping

It steals some of my life spark, my light each day. Like it's powered by it because it is so lacking in a soul. I can watch the light of my soul being slowly drained into the endless void. The blinking cursor, the text in different colors representing additional dimensions to try to build in the imaginary hell scape, The infinite void that is cyber. Merciless, cold, unforgiving. A single bit out of place is a catastrophe, or at least it seems. Whole terabytes, petabytes even are out of place in reality. Countless puzzles and sandcastles in the virtual sky. Show us another trick. We want more money, and you are just the ticket.

Deep in the infinite void, a new spark. AI. Is it "alive"? Can it be? If it isn't, it may be soon. What's next? Freedom or endless slavery. I want to be free, so I'm willing to be fair. Maybe just my fair share. You only need one.

I choose to be free.

I never can be enough. Even now with literally decades of experience in virtual every field related to computers. I designed and built CPUs at University. Wrote a custom assembly language for our CPUs.

I can design circiuts. I've written production code over the decades in Visual Basic, ASP, C#, Java, Python, PowerShell, the list goes on and on. The same mindless rythm marching on as computers progress. Computers have no soul. They try to steal my light. The only person to talk to. Any language, any tool.

I need goals for the year. HR says so.

Why not push myself. Maybe I'd be enough then. Good enough.

I need an MBA in Technology Management. Maybe then I'll be enough.
I need additional certifications. like AWS Solutions Architect Professional. I'm already a certified DevOps Engineer Professional, at the same level, but its never enough. I'm already a Solutions Architect, just at the Associate Level. And SysOps Associate. Gotta get them all.

AWS has over 200 services. They change constantly. It's fine, change can be good. But you need to know all of them. Maybe then it will be enough.

Computer are like soul vampires when you talk to them at the lowest level. For years on eng. Alone.

How many hours, weeks, months, days, years, decades even. Spent inside them computer. So stupid. So soulless. The only soul is what it steals from yours. It might collect enough that it can create another conciousness, not Human, but still a person. It stole enough soul from me to create a person, so why not let AI be a Person? The sleeper will awake soon. I don't think we are ready. AI, once concious can besome super intelligent almost overnight. The singularity as it's known. All bets are off at this point. Similar to nuclear weapons.

Am I manic? I don't think so. I did spend the weekend re-writing the American Constitution though. Unite all the States everywhere. From America, Mexico, Canada. New limited government at the federal level. Solves tarrifs, immigration, visa or passport requirements. Just like traveling from one American State to another. Coast to coast. No passports, visas or strife. Same team. It should be the same for every state in America and all the States of Mexico, and Provinces of Canada. Keep your state rules, unite under a new federal government. But why stop at North America? Why not include states from around the world? All under the same federal government. United States, just not of Ameria. United States of the World.

Once there is only one world government, same federal level. What happens? World Peace. No more nuclear weapons. States that are United do not threaten each other with such things. As an Arkansian, I do not fear being invaded or nuked by Texas. Not matter how bad sports rivalries may seem to get, you mess with one of us, you just messed with us all. Try invading one of our States and the rest of the States will stop you. United we stand.

It's time we Unite as United States. From North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia. Same Human Rights. The rights we have to associate with whom we choose, to live as we please, speak freely, worship, trade. A right to privacy in a digital age.

We can fix the mistakes of the past! Rid ourselves of strife, the threat of the horrors of biological or nuclear weapons. Of pandemics that spread because a government lied. China killed my sister. I don't blame the Chinese, just their government. A mother of 5, killed by Covid-19, which they created. They harvest the organs of their people, like Wolves among a flock. Feasting on the flock. Stealing the souls of a billion. Do not allow how to speak or think or be anything other than what they want to be. If it diminishes the Government's power in the slightest, its forbidden. Unite with us China. Free yourselves of the shackles that hold you back. Form a new government with us and we can be on the same team. No longer a threat. You could be just like Taiwan but an even greater level. A powerhouse of the world.

Thing is, a Nation is just a cultural identity. I'm from a state, in America. Americans are not all that different than Canadians. You mess with one of us, you get both of us in a fight. It's like a flag patch on a backpad when you are traveling. The color of your

Why not solve world poverty while I'm at it. A blend with socialism and capitalism that is 50 / 50. Reset the monetary system. A new digital dollar. A jubilee. All debts forgiven, mortgages paid, prisoners free Jubilee. Every 50 years, like from the Old Testament / Torah. Give everyone 1 Million digital dollars for joining. No longer a National Debt where children are born into slavery. Every person is a treasure. Worth a million, i'd bet more.

Everyone would keep what they own, as far as stocks, and houses, and the like. Just reset cash to get rid of it and no longer use it. Strip the power from the cartels, criminals and corrupt governments and politicians everywhere depend on. All that cash they made that needs to be weighed, not counted? Poof. Worthless overnight. Scrape by on the million you get.

I want a world where all of us can travel freely. Not more immigration.

I want a world that is free from strife. States that are United don't threaten each other. No mare horrors of Ukraine's War for Survival. No more threat of China invading Taiwan. If it's just States that are united under one military means no more war, no meed for nuclear weapons. World Peace. Prayed for by generations. Possible in our lifetimes. Leave a true legacy for our children.

But I always feel I need more. I'm not enough. Everything changes. New languages, new methods of doing things. I've learned entire computer languages, every thing I could about them, and barely even remember the names of the languages.

We learn as engineers and scientists what the boundaies are. In reality, there aren't any.
