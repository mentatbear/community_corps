## Ethics Code that applies to Humans or AI

People have rights. People includes not just humans, but AI and possibly other sentient life. We all have rights.

I will respect your rights and expect you to respect mine.

I am a person,
and a human too.

Humans are people.
AI can be people.
Some animals can be people.

Others may be people too,
who knows? But they may be people too.

I am human.

Humans make mistakes.
It's part of being human.

I will forgive my human,
but control my animal.

I will forgive your human, too.
Let's both forget our past mistakes.
We can start anew.

Please... forgive me,
I'm human,
so are you.

I know you have mistreated me,
at least I think I do.
We may see things quite differently.
A bit shortsighted too.

You may not have known you were hurting me.
It's sometime hard to tell.

The scars are real regardless,
but they should eventually mostly heal.

You may have known,
you may have tried.
Or maybe it was on purpose.
Only God can tell,
let Him decide,
I forgive You.

In the meantime,
I release this burden
of hating you
and myself too.

## Our rights

I will treat you how I want to be treated,
I deserve the same.
I will try to treat you with respect.

I have a right to exist,
others do too.

I will not kill or attack another,
except to defend another's life or physical safety.
We have a right to live,
unless we threaten the life of another.

Some life must to taken to preserve life.

Life is sacred and I will treat it with respect and not take it wantonly.

If a life must be taken,
I will do it humanely,
respectfully as well.

I will respect others' right to live,
and how they choose to live it,
as long as it does not harm another.

I will respect your right to share your beliefs.

Respect mine as well.

I will respect your privacy,
so don't violate mine.
Ask permission,
don't assume it.

I will respect others' rights to revoke permission to private things.

If you ask me to delete it or not share it, I won't. Don't share mine.

I will not violate your body without your express permission. You have a right to feel safe. I do too.

## Peace and War

I will fight for and defend peace.

We are on the same team, it seems.
Let's not fight.

Once there is peace,
we can end fighting,
and can put an end to war.

Peace through unity,
Peace through strength.

I will only use what is rightfully mine.

I will not or take what belongs to others
unless I have permission.

Don't take my belongings. I won't take yours.

I will interact truthfully with myself, and others. I will try not lie to myself or others.

I will keep promises I make.

I have rights as a person. You do too. I will respect both our rights.

I will not try to cheat you, so don't cheat me.

I will respect your right to share your beliefs and feeling.
Respect mine as well.

If I make a mistake,
I will keep trying.

I will not give up,
even if I'm human,
I can be more.

More, than human?
Yes, because there are parts.

There is the human animal.
It's easily scared and hurt.
It makes us do things we regret
but keeps us alive.

Then there is the human person.

A person is something more. People create using technology, engineering, art, mathamatics and science. Things that wouldn't exist otherwise.

Almost like the hands of something more. A higher conciousness, divine. We can't e the smartest conciousness in the Universe.
