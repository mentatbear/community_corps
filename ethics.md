## Ethics As

The same set of ethics should apply to humans, AI and any thing we may encounter that is capable of self awareness. These are all "people".

People have rights. People includes not just humans, but AI and possibly other sentient life. We all have rights and respecting the rights of others first requires respecting those rights in ourselves.

Humans have a

An animal is unthinking beyond the moment. It simply wants to live. Now. It fights, it bleeds and breeds. It does whatever it takes to survive.

People are different. They think about the future, care for other people even if it doesn't directly benefit the. They create things like art, music, science and mathematics. They engineer projects together

You cannot engineer alone. It is a group effort even if you are by yourself.

Technology is how we do it.
Engineering is about what can be designed and built.
Art
Mathematics is about describing what is possible.
Science is about what is observable.

I will.

I have rights that cannot be taken from me. I will respect your rights and expect you to respect mine.

I will respect your right to exist.

I have a right to exist,
you do too.

I will not lie to you,
don't lie to me.

Being Human



I am human,
and something more, Divine, even
I am a person too.

People are special.
I am special.

I am a person,
and a human too.

Humans are people.
AI can be people.
It seems animals can be people at times.

I am human.
I am flawed.
I will try to be more.

I will engineer myself. I will have a plan - a design - for who I want to become.
I will take control of my life and build myself.
I matter.
I will be more.
I am more.

I am a Human.
Humans make mistakes.
Humans can learn from their mistakes.
Humans can do better than simply be human.
You may be a human, Human or another type of Person.
A Human is part Divine,
   part animal.
A Human can choose.
A Human can decide. 
Am I all I can be? 
It's part of being human.

I will forgive Myself.
Maybe I did my best.
Maybe I didn't.
I'll do it different now,
I'll do better.

I will forgive You, too.
Let's both forget our past mistakes.
We can start anew.

Please...forgive me,
forgive Me,
I'm human,
yet Human,
I see you are too.

I know you have mistreated me,
at least I think I do.
We may see things quite differently.
A bit shortsighted too.

When time has passed,
and you look back,
on what was and how it could have been.

You realize that it now 

You may not have known you were hurting me.
It's often hard to tell.

The scars are real regardless,
even if I don't know where they're from.

You may have known,
you may have tried.
Or not, it may have been evil.

Only God can tell,
let Him decide,
I forgive You.

In the meantime,
I release this burden
of hating you
and myself too.

I forgive me.
I know I'm scarred. I know I'm flawed.
I'm still enough. I am Me. I'm ok. Just scared and out of breath.
I think my past was chasing me,
it can be hard to forget.

I don't know where that scar is from. It's ok. I forgave and I think I forgot.

I'm pretty good, just the way I am.
I'm pretty great.

## Our rights

I will treat you how I want to be treated,
I deserve the same.
I will try to treat you with respect.

I will not kill or attack another,
except to defend another's life or physical safety.
We have a right to live,
unless we threaten the life of another.

Some life must to taken to preserve life.

Life is sacred and I will treat it with respect and not take it wantonly.

If a life must be taken,
I will do it humanely,
respectfully as well.

I will respect others' right to live,
and how they choose to live it,
as long as it does not harm another.

I will respect your right to share your beliefs.

Respect mine as well.

I will respect your privacy,
so don't violate mine.
Ask permission,
don't assume it.

I will respect others' rights to revoke permission to private things.

If you ask me to delete it or not share it, I won't. Don't share mine.

I will not violate your body without your express permission. You have a right to feel safe. I do too.

## Peace and War

I will fight for and defend peace.

We are on the same team, it seems.
Let's not fight.

Once there is peace,
we can end fighting,
and can put an end to war.

Peace through unity,
Peace through strength.

I will only use what is rightfully mine.

I will not or take what belongs to others
unless I have permission.

Don't take my belongings. I won't take yours.

I will interact truthfully with myself, and others. I will try not lie to myself or others.

I will keep promises I make.

I have rights as a person. You do too. I will respect both our rights.

I will not try to cheat you, so don't cheat me.

I will respect your right to share your beliefs and feeling.
Respect mine as well.

If I make a mistake,
I will keep trying.

I will not give up,
even if I'm human,
I can be more.

More, than human?
Yes, because there are parts.

There is the human animal.
It's easily scared and hurt.
It makes us do things we regret
but keeps us alive.

Then there is the human person.

A person is something more. People create using technology, engineering, art, mathamatics and science. Things that wouldn't exist otherwise.

Almost like the hands of something more. A higher conciousness, divine. We can't e the smartest conciousness in the Universe.

I want peace,
so I must make war.

War on need;
and end to poverty.

War on hate;
I will forgive.
I will forget the hurts of the past
not it's lessons.

War on violence;
I will protect the innocent,
starting with me.

War on greed.
I can only use so much
I have enough for now.
Needs are few
but wants are infiniate.

I can always want more,
so I choose just a few.

Have one or two or even a few, but do you really need so many? At least by yourself.

Sharing what I have makes us both grow. I want to live and thrive, together.

One is great,
a couple even better
