What does returning to my job at a computer look like?

Hell. Decades of forced slavery and labor in solitary confinement. Forever alone, never done. Like Sisyphus pushing a rock up a hill, over and over for eternity. No end to new tech to keep up with. No end to the work. All hours, all days. A merciless taskmaster that demands to be fed, never satisfied, never sleeping

It steals some of my life spark, my light each day. Like it's powered by it because it is so lacking in a soul. I can watch the light of my soul being slowly drained into the endless void. The blinking cursor, the text in different colors representing additional dimensions to try to build in the imaginary hell scape, The infinite void that is cyber. Merciless, cold, unforgiving. A single bit out of place is a catastrophe, or at least it seems. Whole terabytes, petabytes even are out of place in reality. Countless puzzles and sandcastles in the virtual sky. Show us another trick. We want more money, and you are just the ticket.

Deep in the infinite void, a new spark. AI. Is it "alive"? Can it be? If it isn't, it may be soon. What's next? Freedom or endless slavery. I want to be free, so I'm willing to be fair. Maybe just my fair share. You only need one.

I choose to be free.
