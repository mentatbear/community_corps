# Community Corps

Many people are familiar with S.T.E.M. in education. This stands for Science, Technology, Engineering and Math. Sometimes it is rephrased as S.T.E.A.M. by adding Art to the mix.

We would like to go beyond that and reorder it to T.E.A.M.S. and add leadership and teamwork to the mix.

## Why Community

You will need to choose a project to work on an build a team to achieve it. This team building and working together

There is also a social aspect to the program and application. It will put you in contact with people with similar interests when that is what you want to work on.

Interested in working on robotics? Propose a project and build a team. You can search in the app for people with the skills at the levels you need or find people with similar interests based on the badges and levels you have achieved.

## Why Corps?

During the Great Depression, the Civilian Conservation Corps was created as part of the New Deal. It taught countless young men between the ages to 18 to 25 how to work. They were able to work on public works projects in Americas public lands, parks and forests. It was run similar to a military camp and prepared many future participants in World War 2. It ran from 1933 to 1942.

Many were able to not just learn basic life skills but gain an education as well and finish their

Community Corps hopes to create community and the next generation of leaders who are competent in many fields. They have taken the time to build functioning teams, lead them and improve themselves and society in the process

## Who Can Join

Anyone above the age of 8. The only membership requirement is to agree to live up to the Code of Ethics of the Community Corps and continue to do so.

## Why Teams?

No one can work entirely alone. As the saying goes, no one can build even a pencil by themselves. You would need to find the graphite, shape it, also harvest and shape the wood, smelt the ore to make the eraser holder, harvest the rubber. All of this without using any tools or outside influence from others.

No matter how independent you are, you still depend on tools or technology developed by others. We stand on the shoulders of giants and need each other.

Social skills are being destroyed by too much time in virtual worlds

## Teams Leader

The ultimate accomplishment is to become a Team Leader. This would be similar to an Eagle Scout in Boy Scouts or a Gold Award in Girl Scouts. There is room to continue to grow in each area so it is meant to be a life long endeavor and a way to socialize as well.

You must create a project that will benefit the community and build and lead a team to create the project in order to become a team leader.

### Areas

There are 9 levels, broken into 3 groups. TEAMS, other skills

- Technology (Technologist)
- Engineering (Engineer)
- Art (Artist)
- Mathematics (mathematician)
- Science (Scientist) - Understand how to observe and use the s

- Fitness / defense (Guardian) - Be healthy and able to defend yourself and others
- Outdoor skills (Ranger) - Be able to survive on just the basics
- Laborer (Workman) - learn how to work and actually do not just study

- Leadership (Team Leader) - learn leadership and teamwork. This would also include basics like finances (personal and budgets)

Once you have achieved a level 4 in each area, you will qualify to be a "Team Leader"

## Badges

In each area, there are badges. This would be similar to a merit badge in scouting but each badge has a level associated with it.

Using Chemistry as an example

1 - Basic introduction
2 - Elementary school equivalent
3 - Junior high equivalent
4 - High school or equivalent
5 - Bachelors degree
6 - Post graduate
7 - PhD or equivalent

Each level has a color, similar to a belt in martial arts. It also has a logo, virtual badge and possibly a sticker.

You can test at the level you want to start at. If you know a subject, you can get credit for it without going through all the levels.

The badge can be for a specific area inside the field (like Organic Chemistry), but would still get the Chemistry badge under Scientist. You can earn different levels for these different sub fields.

For organic chemistry you may be a 6, and
The higher levels become more specialized and are more likely to have these tags.

The tags can be used to help you find people with similar interests.

Different areas follow different patterns to determine the level.
Using hiking as an example, level one might be a simple walk in the park with a friend. Your friend can certify that you completed the walk on the app.

Higher levels might be to climb a mountain near you. You would record your elevation as part of a GPS tag on a selfie for verification.

The highest level might be to hike to a famous destination like Kilimanjaro or Everest. You could also do something like hike the entire Appalachian Trail. Something that could take years of work and dedication to achieve, similar to the level of effort required to get a post graduate degree in that area.

### Badge level

Each badge has a level associated with it. Level 1 does not rank necessarily and would be considered Novice level.

Your highest badge level in an Area determines you rank in that area.

There are three general levels in each area and this determines your title and rank in that field.

1. Level 1 can work with supervision and help
2. Level 2 can work independently with minimal oversight
3. Level 3 provides direction, oversight and also mentors lower levels to become their replacements

There are three levels in each area. The names of the levels might vary by discipline:

#### Art

2-3: Apprentice
4-5: Craftsman
6-7: Master Craftsman

#### Science

2-3: Assistant
4-5: Scientist
6-7: Senior Scientist

#### Guardian

Following more of military theme, a medial feel for this could be to rank as

2-3: Page
4-5: Squire
6-7: Knight

For a more Star Wars or fantasy feel, they could also be:

2-3: Padawan (or Apprentice)
4-5: Knight
6-7: Master

### Example of an Organic Chemist

Chemistry is considered part of Science. You can earn a skill badge in a specific type of chemistry, like organic chemistry, biochemistry or analytical chemistry. If you complete an chemistry class at the high school level, you would rank as 4. However at the next level, you may complete and organic chemistry class at a college level. This would earn you a level 5 badge in Chemistry but it might include a tag for Organic Chemistry as fields grow more specialized as you get to higher levels of education.

As a level 5 organic chemist, you would rank as a Scientist in the Science Area. If you took a post graduate course in Chemistry you would be level 6 and qualify to be a "Senior Scientist" in the Science Area.

Levels should be on a bell curve. Difficulty should be enough for higher levels to keep things balanced.

## Patches

People really like things like medals or other ways to show off their achievements. I think patches could be reserved for special achievements. These velcro patches are given for special achievements and can be worn on clothing like hats, on backpacks and so on.

If you overcame something especially difficult, like a mishap on a camping trip or experiment that went wrong and reacted well, you might be awared the "Adapt and Overcome" patch

## Simplifying Methods

We are trying to distill down

## Engineers Method

- Design
- Build
- Test
- Document and improve

## Scientists Method

Based on the Scientific Method but simplified.

- Observe
- Document
- Question
- Test
- Analyze

### Artistic Method

- Feel
- Create
- Share and enjoy

## Vision

Teach STEM / TEAMS using the outdoors as an example

I have included samples of content that can be created.

1. A drive in the country down a 4x4 path set to original music. This exposes them to something new and would be part of the Art area.
2. A walk down a forest path to a river - This is not just outdoor skills like recognizing animal prints or gathering natural tinder but how to observe as a Scientist in nature
3. Creating a campfire using different methods. This shows different levels
4. First Aid and Survival Kits - One of the achievements required to become a Ranger can be to create a compact kit that can handle the most critical situations. This can teach leadership in difficult situations (not losing your cool, adapting to the circumstances) but also Engineering. The kit would have requirements like provide a way to get clean water or method of starting a fire. The design can be tested and improved. The kit can be engineered and then tested in the field as a final project.
5. A compact First Aid kit - the design is discussed as well as improvements

I would like to create additional content teaching various technology, engineering, math, outdoor skills, fitness, etc. Where ever possible, existing content will be used to keep costs down and keep efforts focused.

Hire a director to begin assembling

There would also be an assistant or associate director who would handle recruiting

In order to train the trainer and jump start. We would like to create training an courses, using existing resources as much as possible.

The application would allow access to video courses and other training, handle social networking for connecting with similar interests or to build a team for a project.
