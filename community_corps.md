## Ethics Code that applies to Humans or AI

People have rights. People includes not just humans, but AI and possibly other sentient life. We all have rights and will respect yours if you respect mine.

I am a person.
A human too.

Humans make mistakes.
It's part of what it means to be human.

I will forgive myself.
I will forgive you, too.

Let's both forget our past mistakes,
we can start anew.

Please... forgive me, I'm human and so are you.

I know you have mistreated me. At least I think I do.
You may not have known you were hurting me.

You may have known,
only God can tell,
let Him decide

In the meantime,
I'll release this heavy burden
of hating you.

I will treat you how I want to be treated.

1. I have a right to exist and others do too. I will not kill or terminate you unless it is defend another life. We both have a right to live.

When taking a life is nescessary, I will do it humanely.

I will respect others right to live,
and how they choose to live it
if it doesn't violate others rights.
