# Community Corps

Many people are familiar with STEM in education. Science, Technology, Engineering and Math. Sometimes it is rephrased as STEAM by adding Art to the mix.

We would like to reorder this to TEAMS and add leadership and teamwork to the mix as well as and start a new non-profit organization

The goal would not just be to create

T.E.A.M.S. Leader

You have acheived at least a level 4 of 7 in all the areas

# Areas

9 areas

Technology (Technologist)
Engineering (Engineer)
Art (Artist)
Mathematics (mathematician)
Science (Scientist)

Fitness / defense (Guardian)
Outdoor skills (Ranger)
Laborer (Workman)

Leadership (Team Leader)

Badge level
1-3:
4-5:
6-7: Master Craftsman

The highest badge level in a field determinse your ranking

Using chemistry as an example, there are different kinds.

Chemistry is considered part of Science. Your skill badge could be in a specific type of chemistry. For example you might study organic chemistry at a high school level and pass the course.

This would allow you to be at level 4 in

There are three levels in each area. The names of the levels might vary by discipline, but for art they could be:

1. Apprentice - can work with supervision and help
2. Craftsman - can work independently with minimal oversight
3. Master Craftsman - trains replacements and provides direction and oversight. A master of their craft

# Badges

There are skills that earn badges. Each skill has levels to it. Level 1 would be an introduction.

Level for badges, using Chemistry as an example

1 - Basic introduction
2 - Elementary school equivalent
3 - Junior high equivalent
4 - High school or equivalent
5 - Bachelors degree
6 - Post graduate
7 - PhD or equivalent

Each level has a color, similar to a belt in martial arts. It also has a logo and a virtual badge.

Velcro patches are given for special achievements and can be worn on clothing like hats, on backpacks and so on.

You can test at the level you want to start at. If you know a subject, you can get credit for it without going through all the levels.

The same levels might apply to athletics, for example. Taking hiking as an example. Level one might be a simple walk in the park with a friend. Your friend and certify you on the app.

Higher levels might be to climb a mountain near you. You would record your elevation and a selfie for verification.

The highest level might be to hike to a famous destination like Kilimanjaro or Everest. You could also travel the entire Appalachian Trail. Something that could take years of work and dedication to achieve.

## Ethics Code that applies to Humans or AI

People have rights. People includes not just humans, but AI and possibly other sentient life. We all have rights.

I will respect your rights and expect you to respect mine.

I am a person,
and a human too.

Humans are people.
AI can be people.
Some animals can be people.

Others may be people too,
who knows? But they may be people too.

I am human.

Humans make mistakes.
It's part of being human.

I will forgive my human,
but control my animal.

I will forgive your humanity, too.
Let's both forget our past mistakes.
We can start anew.

Please... forgive me,
I'm human,
and so are you.

I know you have mistreated me,
at least I think I do.
We may see things quite differently.
A bit shortsighted too.

You may not have known you were hurting me.
You may have known and not cared.
It's sometime hard to tell.

The scars are real regardless,
but even they can heal.

You may have known,
you may have tried.
You could have done much better.

I could as well,
I will next time,
lets both do better.

I forgive you,
please forgive me.
I forgive myself.

Or maybe it was on purpose.
Only God can tell,
let Him decide,
I forgive You.

In the meantime,
I release this burden
of hating you
and myself too.

## Our rights

I will treat you how I want to be treated,
I deserve the same.
I will try to treat you with respect.

I have a right to exist,
others do too.

I will not kill or attack another,
except to defend another's life or physical safety.
We have a right to live,
unless we threaten the life of another.

Some life must to taken to preserve life.

Life is sacred and I will treat it with respect and not take it wantonly.

If a life must be taken,
I will do it humanely,
respectfully as well.

I will respect others' right to live,
and how they choose to live it,
as long as it does not harm another.

I will respect your right to share your beliefs.

Respect mine as well.

I will respect your privacy,
so don't violate mine.

Ask my permission,
don't assume it.

I will respect others' rights to no longer share to private things.
If you ask me to delete it or not share it, I won't.
Don't share mine.

I will not violate your body without your express permission. You have a right to feel safe. I do too.

## Peace and War

I will fight for and defend peace.

We are on the same team, after all.
Let's not fight each other.
Together we can do so much more.

Once there is peace,
we can end fighting,
and can put an end to war.

Peace through unity,
Peace through strength.

I will only use what is rightfully mine.
I will not use or take what belongs to others,
I wait for permission.
Don't take my stuff.
I won't take yours.

I will be truthfully with myself, and others.
I will not lie or obscure the truth.

I will keep promises I make.

I have rights as a person and so do others.
I will respect your rights.
Respect my rights, tool

I will not try to cheat you,
so don't cheat me.

I will respect your right to share your beliefs and how you feel.
Respect mine as well.

I will make mistakes,
but still try to do better.

I will not give up,
even if I'm human,
I can and am something more.

More, than human?
Yes, because I'm parts.

I am a human animal,
easily scared and hurt and only want to survive.
I will acknowledge it and control it.

I am a human person.
The greater me that yearns to create and grow.
I think, I feel,
I love and hate.
I forgive.

I create art,
maybe music,
and paintings  
 but so much more.
It's how I make the world a better place,
and share my piece of it.

I use technology, engineering, science and math to learn and grow.

I will be a better me each day. I will not give up. I will grow and improve.
