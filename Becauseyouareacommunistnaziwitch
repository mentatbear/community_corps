# Why


Dad, I want a world that Jesus can return to. One that will finally listen to him. He tried to do it peacefully. I don't think it's working and it's time to try something else.

I need a voice. I need to speak, but it is like I am mute. I try to speak, I try to explain but no one understands. I suppose my keyboard and be my voice but I need your help amplifying it.

A few of the girls you've show me aren't too bad either. Maybe I can get one sometime and get a baby or two? Just asking. For a friend.

I need you. I want you to be a part of my life.
