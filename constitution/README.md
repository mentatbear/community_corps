## Proposed Constitution

A Person can join the United States by promising to follow the Code of Ethics, agreeing to follow the Laws of the United States and by also belonging to a State that is part of the United States. Location of birth, nationality, ethnicity, sex or belief system does not affect anyone's ability to join. Any Person can join and agree to be bound by the promises and protections of this Constitution of the United States of Earth, know as the United States. Upon joining, a Person of Majority becomes a Citizen of the United States with the right to vote in elections, serve on Juries as well as serve as an Officer of the United States including as a Judge, Senator or Executive.

A Person is sentient and capable of independent thought. This includes Humans, and likely will soon include AI as well. Other life forms may also be recognized to have sentience at some point.

Upon birth or when joining the United States as a Person, an account for that person will be created and credited with 1 000 000 digital credits. A human reaches Age of Majority after 20 standard years. A Person of Majority is entitled to vote in elections.

A Person of Minority will earn 7% interest (or 70 000 per year) until they reach Age of Majority at 20 standard year. The interest is used to cover food, shelter, clothing, medical care and all other basic needs until you become Person of Majority. Your parents or guardians will determine how this money is spent, but once you reach the Age of Majority you will gain control of the account. Only 10% of an account can be spent in a year. Basic medical insurance and a universal basic income come from half of your fund when you receive it at Age of Majority. If you spent less growing up, you will have a larger monthly income growing up. Your original principal of 1 000 000 cannot be spent by your parents, only money from the interest payments every year. These payments symbolize society investing and betting on you. We think you are worth a lot more and a million to us.

The other half is yours to spend or invest as you see fit. It is your capital to use as you see fit.

The goal of the Government should be efficiency and automation. Laws should be written to the are understandable even to Persons of Minority who are old enough to understand right from wrong.

Write laws in something like the computer language python so the law is clear, concise and understandable to most humans and AI. Simplify, do not complicate. A well written law should be simple, and may be complex but should not be complicated.

Every 50 years after adoption, the digital credits system, including any debts will reset. This constitution and any existing laws will need to be re-ratified along with any revisions.

The Government is funded by a 10% tax when digital credits are spent. An income tax is forbidden as privacy cannot exist when there is one.

The Parliament sets the Government budget.

### State

States exist all throughout the world. Many have their own consitions and collections of states . Examples of states include the States of Arkansas and Texas in America. They are United so they do not fight.

States often join to form Nations, but Nations can also exist inside a State. A Nation is a cultural identity but it is often a Federation of States.

Examples include California, Alaska and Virginia in America, or the provinces of Alberta and Calgary in Canada. Mexico has States like . And this is just North America.

Around the world, there are equivalent political structures like prefectures in Japan.

### A Nation is a cultral identity, not a State boundary. Each Person can select any National Identity regardless of location. The primary National Identity is set at birth but can be chosen when a person becomes a Person.

Since Laws are expected to be followed by everyone, they should be understandable to a

If all of the states around the world What problems could that solve?

Hey, States. If you were United, no more War. No more nukes.

America should use Pax Americana, and a bit of being more united.

Revisit the Constitution. Simplify it so an 8 year old can understand. No more Laws you can't understand without paying for help, yet you are required to be bound by it?

Create a new United States based on a simplified, revised Constitution. Constitution of the United Stages.

Join or Die. Carrot or stick. Welcome to the United States 2.0.

Hopefully, just in time for America's big birthday coming up. 250 years.

1. We were born into it, and didn't agree to our current form of government. We can create a new one.
