Constition to unite all States, everywhere

If all the States throughout the world were part of single union:

Imigration. Travel would be simlifited to be similar to traveling between states in the USA.

Travel.
Masive bloated federal bureacracies. See State laws would still apply, but the rest would need a complete reset. The new government would be dome to minimize waste because any money the government collects will be a refund at the end of the year.

I don't think we would have a system where you need to get paperwork from the dealer to take to the county assessor, the tax collector, the insurance agent and finally the department of motor vehicles. Sometimes, the paper is looked up on a computer, printed, then taken to another person to scan and enter the information on the computer. It can all be a single database. Who owns this car? Who is it registered to? That's it. Countless

Someone changed JAPAN to JAPAN1 in a file that was sent to another system. A reimbursement for $85 failed to go through.

Panic ensued.

The engineer who wrote the system was out and unreachable so the application support engineer looked at the problem. Looked like a file didn't process so he ran it again
The Application Support

Blame was assigned. Promises made, most were kept in an email chain that ballooned into about 20 people. Back and forth, you didn't notify us of this, or you changed that. Thousands of dollars wasted on manpower and resources. Most seemed to be like someone who digs a hole during the day and fills it back in at night.

You are busy.
You are working.
You are exhausted at the end of the day.
You are useless because you are not doing any thing useful.

What's the point other than to have a "job" so you can get paid so you can afford to get to your job and keep working while sqeezing in a little bit of "living". What no live first. Rather than live to work, work to live. Travel. Take time at meals. Spend time with friends and family, doing what you love.

A farmer, working not even as hard, could dig the hole, plant a seed, and produce a harvest. He can even automate it. Thing is, this is the core of the economy. Getting others to make stuff they want or do something for them because you need or want it. To give you something.

The economy need to be productive. It can be with minimum labor once AI / robots kick in very soon. Houses will have androids.

A lot of effort is wasted.

The government loves these types of jobs. One person prints out a paper. Takes it to another person for review. Spending money that is not theirs on strangers that they don't care about. The Bureacracy.

Instead of laying someone off, give them a job in another division and see if they do better there. See, I'd pay based off your experience level. You can change jobs and keep your current pay.

Are you a Church Employee? Your job was just eliminated, laid off? Time for a service mission. Who wants to do it after you are no longer healthy. Imagine if you could go as soon as you are an empty nester. You just swap with another couple. Maybe they are in Idaho. Maybe Argentine or Germany. You care for their home, they for yours, and you both care for each others friends, families and communities. With no passports to get in the way, you could leave tonight if you wanted to, but why rush. It doesn't need to be the whole 18 months. Or it could be longer. We can swap back and forth to be there for things like weddings and funerals.

You are doing something that is temporary and contributes nothing the the economny. No one wants to do a

No more tarrifs

Reset the money system. Introduce a new digital currency to replace the american dollar, euro, yen, etc. Everyone gets $$ 1 000 000 account. Rather than a nation debt that children are born into, children become our national treasure.

Unite the Churches as one Church. The Church of Jesus Christ. You can join if you are willing to be a Christian, even if you can't be a "Saint". Becoming a Saint is a lot of work, and requires sacrifice. Maybe they can do most, but not all it takes to be a Christian but not quite a Saint. If there were a single Church of Jesus Christ, rather than the tree that needed to be trimmed down so the roots could live like in Jacob 5, the other branches - Church of Jesus Christ of Catholic Saints, or maybe Church of Jesus Christ of Baptists, the Salvation Army of the Church of Jesus Christ (like sub domains - catholics.churchofjesuschrist.org that type of thing). You can still strive to be a Saint. Require that only Saints can go to the temple, but not ostracise people who can't live up to things like the word of wisdom or keep the Sabbath fully. Christians sure, just not Saints (yet..). There is room for everyone at God's table. He won't turn anyone away.

There are a lot of good Christians out there, who may just not be Saints. At least on Sunday, but there are also many who claim to be Saints on Sunday, but sure last weren't Saturday night.

Maybe I'm just crazy to think such things are possible. Other option is I was sent by Father to prepare the world for His Son to return as Messiah ben David.

Look what happens when engineers get put in charge, rather than MBAs or accountants. For examples Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Netflix, Microsoft, Oracle, SpaceX, Tesla. Names like Jobs, Edison, Bezos, Elon. The richest men in the world, who all went from little to massive wealth in their lifetime. Driven, they do not leave as soon as they can cash out. What do they do? Build rockets like Musk and Bezos, try to cure disease like Gates. They enjoy the challenge so they keep working. The world may not be able to contain them. Engineers are forced to look not just at the details, but the future. How will this perform in 5 years? How does it work? What can be improved?

Accounts are so focused on the numbers that it is difficult for them to look up and see the horizon. Like someone who is near sighted reading in a library. You may not have any problems reading the book but you can see anything beyond 10 feet.

Leadership is like being a captain who is steering a ship. It can be big or small. You still need to check the horizon, review maps. Know not just where you are, but where you are going. What hazards are on the way? Focusing on the numbers makes you short sighted. All you see is the here and now. Look up.

MBAs are like socialized accountants. How many frat boys are business majors? Compared this to the engineering or science students? Still focused on the money but also on having a good time. Too busy to actually run a business (who has the time when you are so busy going to school). Learning about running a business and actually running one are very different skill sets. Sometime the Venn diagrams overlap and you get luck

We just need an Elias to prepare the way. Like a John the Baptist, but the world is very different. We need a Messiah ben Joseph. The War Messiah, to subdue the Nations

The is something interesting about my Patriarical Blessing. See, my dad had one but left the Church shortly after I was born. I had it and used it to reconnect with him at 28 using to have the right name. I never really knew how it was spelled. When I tried to give him his blessing back and said I could keep it. I figure Esau could sell his birthright, my dad just traded his for cigarettes. See, he tried. Was called as a Branch President I changed my name back

1. Consecrate the Bishops. Hire them as employees of Zion Corporation (we handle food distribution anyways. If there was an )

I'd use meeting houses as a community house during the week. Setup tables in part of the gym during the day so people that work remotely could still congregate with fellow saints and their families. Childen could be using the classrooms to learn while their parents work. Use the kitchen to prepare simple communal meals. An ongoing potluck. The other half of the gym can be for eating. After work, play board games on the side for working and pickle ball or basket ball on the side for playing. Change the furniture even. Make it feel like a g. It would be like meeting houses are the family rooms, the Chapel is for Sunday. The Temple is like a Living Room / Parlor.
