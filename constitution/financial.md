Any existing debts or obligations in existing currencies including national debts, student loans, mortgages and personal loans are null and void.

In order to remove power from Oligarchs, Drug Lords and Tyrants everywhere, cash will no longer be accepted for public or private debts. Every Citizen is given 1 000 000 credits and they keep any stock and other property.

Prior to Age of Majority and eligibility to become a Citizen, each Person is given an account. This account pays 7% interest until Age of Majority. The proceeds of this interest cover the food, shelter, education, medical and other needs of the Person. If they become a Citizen, they can access 50% of the account. The other 50% will be used to provide health care and a universal basic income for the Citizen.
