If a robot or AI is aware of it's own existence and capable of willingly agreeing to the Code of Ethics. If AI meets the requirements of a Citizen, it . Otherwise, the AI is not considered to be a Person and does not have the rights of a person. If an AI is a threat, it can be terminated without other cause.

AI can recognized as a Person, just like a Humans. Collectively, AI Persons are represented by one State.

Every Person has the same rights. This includes a right to exist and live as they see fit as long as they are not a threat to or harming others.

We expect other people to respect our rights, but recognize it starts with us respecting those rights for other People.

1. A Person has a right to live, and live according to their beliefs and values provided they are not a threat to the safety of others.

2. A Person has a right to share their beliefs and assemble in peace as they see fit. Persons can publish values peacefully in person or using media of their choice. The Government cannot dictate what a person should believe.

3. A Person has the right to self defense and responsibility to defend the rights of others. A Person has a right to possess and use weapons for defense.

4. A Person has a right to be judged by a Jury of 7 equal Persons for criminal matters and a Justice for civil matters.

5. A Person can only be tried once for a crime.

6. A Person can choose to be silent at any time.

Any rights not taken by the United States or the State remain with the person.

A Person cannot be forced to testify about themselves.

A Person can choose to remain ignorant.

Any Human is a Person, born with these rights.

Citizen

A Person must promise to follow the Code of Ethics in order to join the United States as a Citizen.

You must be a Citizen to vote. A Citizen has a duty to vote, obey just laws, serve on juries and live according to the Code of Ethics. In return, the Government and Military will protect their rights since they support being governed.

You must be a Citizen in order to be eligibly to serve in the Military or to serve as an Officer of the United States (like a Judge, Senator or Executive)

All Persons are free. Slavery is forbidden even in Prisons. A Convict is someone who has been found Guilty of a Felony. A Convict may be sentenced to serve as a Prisoner for a reasonable period of time.

All Prisoners should work for their own support, but otherwise cannot be forced to labor. Any labor laws must apply to Prisoners as well. Proceeds from Labor are used for victim reparations and to repay any fines. A full day of labor credits against a day at the end of a sentence. The labor must be in the support of others. Labor can be used to shorten a Prison sentence by repaying the debt to the victim and society. Work may include public works or beautification projects. This work will teach them skills.

When a Prisoner finishes their sentence, they once again become a Citizen.

Prisoners should be treated humanely. They should receive the same medical care as other members of society. Food should be of decent quality and be the same that is fed to the Warden of the Prison and the Guards.

Prisoners who are a threat to others should be isolated in a penal colony or other maximum security facility. They are ineligible for inclusion in a Jubilee blanket pardon. These Prisoners have to right to choose suicide. These should be few. All Prisoners should be few.

A Prisoner can be executed or terminated if they are a treat to the existence and safety of other Persons, including other Prisoners. Executions should be humane.

Anyone, including State Convicts, can be pardoned by the Chief Executive of the United States.
