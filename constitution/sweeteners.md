- 10K credits for each handgun. $1 a bullet. Collectors will keep the best around. They are collectibles. If you really want one for self defense, you can keep it. Just make sure it's secure because it's now worth 10 K.
- Mortgages forgiven - Keep the house you are in free of a mortgage. Keep a cabin or family home, but give the extra to the homeless or deserving of a new home. We have room for everybody, somewhere out of the heat or cold. Or we should at least.
- Other debts forgiven - the were in old currencies. Lets start over. Give everyone a reset every Jubilee

Your local customs and state are still governed by the same laws as they are right now. Only Federal laws will change but they will be dramatically simplified.

Taxation is transparent. 10% tax when digital credits are spent. This is built into the currency. Any excess funds from the Government are returned to the people as an incentive to keep it efficient.

# Countries Which May Want to Join

Xi. The Chinese people deserve Freedom, like Taiwan. Imagine what they can do, freed from what holds them back. Be Free, free of Xi. Unite.

- Kim Jong Un
  He is a fat little piggy after feeding on his people. Needs forks. Poke him and his friends for each time you were hungry. He got fat off of his people. A Wolf. If he can be elected in a fair election, maybe he's do alright, being divine and all.
- Putin
  He is overdue for an appointment in Hell. Once his money disapears his power will too. He gets 1 000 000 like everyone else if you stop accepting other money than credits. Fair is fair.
- Russian Oligarchs
  They need to return the shares of stock they stole and wages they with held (certainly delayed for inflation to kick in) to the Soviet People.

  Return Crimea and Eastern Ukraine to Kiev. Pick a boat and live on it and see how far your 1 000 000 go
