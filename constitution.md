# Updating the Constitution for United States

## Introduction

Most of our governments are based on constitutions. The only problem is we didn't actively agree to be bound by the constitution and it's laws, rather, we were born into it.

A government is essentially the reflection of the values of a people. You are the heir of the collective work of all of the previous generations.

We can give devices that are magic to every person alive. All we have to do is share.

We threaten to end it. Blow it all away in a moment. It doesn't matter if it's a nuke, artillery or a drone that destroyed your home. It's gone.

Why? I didn't agree to listen to him anyway.

What do you say to a dictator? No. I will not kill on your behalf, even if you kill me.
Sounds easy. It isn't. If you swing at the king, don't miss.

Together, we can form a government of our choosing. Keep our national identities, but join as States that are based on our existing States, Provinces, Prefectures or Regions. If we were to Unite as States and from a newer, larger United States, many changes we create for ourselves would go away, almost overnight.

- You would be free to travel without needing passports, visas, etc. Imigration is no longer an issue. I'm a citizen of Arkansas but can travel to California. Live and work there. I'm not considered an immigrant. Legal or illegal, no one checked my papers. Yet, from States of Mexico, we can't.
- Duties / Tariffs - Commerce between States is regulated by the Legislature
- Extradition - Other than State to State, extradition is no longer needed between Nations
- Border disputes
- The causes of many wars
- Taking advantage of labor markets

Eventually, there would just be one military, which we could downsize and eliminate things like nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, mines and so on. Peaceful states can get along collectively.

Arkansas is on the same footing as California, Alberta, Texas. States that are United do not war with each other. It's been a long time since any States in America invaded each other or got into a fight.

A new financial system can be created and many existing problems solved.

A digital dollar can use fully automated accounting and auditing

Any existing debts including national debts, student loans, mortgages and personal loans would be null and void.
