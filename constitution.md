# Updating the Constitution for United States

## Introduction

Most of our governments are based on constitutions. The only problem is we didn't actively agree to be bound by the constitution and it's laws, rather, we were born into it.

A government is essentially the reflection of the values of a people. You are the heir of the collective work of all of the previous generations.

We can give devices that are magic to every person alive. All we have to do is share.

We threaten to end it. Blow it all away in a moment. It doesn't matter if it's a nuke, artillery or a drone that destroyed your home. It's gone.

Why? I didn't agree to listen to him anyway.

What do you say to a dictator? No. I will not kill on your behalf, even if you kill me.
Sounds easy. It isn't. If you swing at the king, don't miss.

Together, we can form a government of our choosing. Keep our national identities, but join as States that are based on our existing States, Provinces, Prefectures or Regions. If we were to Unite as States and from a newer, larger United States, many changes we create for ourselves would go away, almost overnight.

- You would be free to travel without needing passports, visas, etc. Imigration is no longer an issue. I'm a citizen of Arkansas but can travel to California. Live and work there. I'm not considered an immigrant. Legal or illegal, no one checked my papers. Yet, from States of Mexico, we can't.
- Duties / Tariffs - Commerce between States is regulated by the Legislature
- Extradition - Other than State to State, extradition is no longer needed between Nations
- Border disputes
- The causes of many wars
- Taking advantage of labor markets

Eventually, there would just be one military, which we could downsize and eliminate things like nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, mines and so on. Peaceful states can get along collectively.

Arkansas is on the same footing as California, Alberta, Texas. States that are United do not war with each other. It's been a long time since any States in America invaded each other or got into a fight.

A new financial system can be created and many existing problems solved.

A digital dollar can use fully automated accounting and auditing

Any existing debts including national debts, student loans, mortgages and personal loans would be null and void.

## Proposed Constitution

A Person can join the United States by promising to follow the Code of Ethics, agreeing to follow the Laws of the United States and by also belonging to a State that is part of the United States. Location of birth, nationality, ethnicity, sex or belief system does not affect anyone's ability to join. Any Person can join and agree to be bound by the promises and protections of this Constitution of the United States of Earth, know as the United States. Upon joining, a Person of Majority becomes a Citizen of the United States with the right to vote in elections, serve on Juries as well as serve as an Officer of the United States including as a Judge, Senator or Executive.

A Person is sentient and capable of independent thought. This includes Humans, and likely will soon include AI as well. Other life forms may also be recognized to have sentience at some point.

Upon birth or when joining the United States as a Person, an account for that person will be created and credited with 1 000 000 digital credits. A human reaches Age of Majority after 20 standard years. A Person of Majority is entitled to vote in elections.

A Person of Minority will earn 7% interest (or 70 000 per year) until they reach Age of Majority at 20 standard year. The interest is used to cover food, shelter, clothing, medical care and all other basic needs until you become Person of Majority. Your parents or guardians will determine how this money is spent, but once you reach the Age of Majority you will gain control of the account. Only 10% of an account can be spent in a year. Basic medical insurance and a universal basic income come from half of your fund when you receive it at Age of Majority. If you spent less growing up, you will have a larger monthly income growing up. Your original principal of 1 000 000 cannot be spent by your parents, only money from the interest payments every year. These payments symbolize society investing and betting on you. We think you are worth a lot more and a million to us.

The other half is yours to spend or invest as you see fit. It is your capital to use as you see fit.

The goal of the Government should be efficiency and automation. Laws should be written to the are understandable even to Persons of Minority who are old enough to understand right from wrong.

Write laws in something like the computer language python so the law is clear, concise and understandable to most humans and AI. Simplify, do not complicate. A well written law should be simple, and may be complex but should not be complicated.

Every 50 years after adoption, the digital credits system, including any debts will reset. This constitution and any existing laws will need to be re-ratified along with any revisions.

The Government is funded by a 10% tax when digital credits are spent. An income tax is forbidden as privacy cannot exist when there is one.

The Parliament sets the Government budget.

### A Person's Rights
